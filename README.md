## LangApp23
It's a website that allows users to upload PDF files and then view them with the ability to click on every word from the PDF and see a full Wiktionary (Wikpedia dictionary) entry for it. The website is currently available on https://langapp23.onrender.com/frontend/about . 

# How it works
On the Upload page, users can upload their own PDF, that is sent to a Python Flask server at Render.com. The server strips the PDF down to pages and then to individual words. For every word, the server makes requests to Wiktionary to find the basic version of a word. After finding the basic version of every word, the Flask server returns the JSON-ified text of the PDF and a dictionary with each word and it's basic form. The tile and author of the PDF given by the user and the information from the Flask server are then saved to MongoDB (a Non-Relational, NoSQL, Document-based database). The website allows users to view every file uploaded to it in the JSON-ified form saved to MongoDB. Every file has an associated dictionary generated by the Flask server, thanks to which the backend can make accurate, on-time searches in the Wiktionary dump for full description of a word the user has clicked on. 
It would be entirely possible to save a full description of every word to MongoDB while looking for its basic form on Wiktionary. The extra searches by the backend in the Wiktionary dump would then be unnecessary. I tried this solution in https://github.com/jakubgrad/langapp, but found it too memory-inefficient, because associating each word with it's Wiktionary html text or even plain text would increase the size of the saved files a few-dozen-fold, making it inefficient for a larger scale application. 
The obvious problem with this hybrid approach is the slowness of making requests to Wiktionary for every word in a PDF. 
A better approach would probably be to use a Flask Python server with access to the Wiktionary dump to search for a form of the word there.

# Is it a serious approach to create a language reading app?
Semi-serious. The UI definitely needs improvement, and so does the method for finding words. The current speed of about a minute for 1 page of a PDF is prohibitively slow, and there is no personalization for users of the website, like saving words or marking progress in a PDF. Though this might come soon, there is also no UI option for flipping pages o_o

# TODO
Have the application find words using Python Flask, improve UI (perhaps using an open-source online text-viewer or the like), perhaps add some other language.
